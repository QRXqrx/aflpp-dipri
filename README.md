## AFL++-DiPri: AFL++ with Distance-based Seed Prioritization.

This is the C/C++ implementation of our paper: 
_DiPri: Distance-based Seed Prioritization for Greybox Fuzzing._
You can read our [FUZZING'23 paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3605157.3605172) or TOSEM paper
(under reviewed  at the time this document is updated) to
learn more about the basic hypothesis and approach designs of DiPri..
This prototype is essentially an extension of the famous community-driven fuzzer
AFL++ (version 4.06).
To learn more about AFL++, please refer to their (GitHub repo)[https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus] or 
read [AFL++ readme](./README.aflpp.md).
